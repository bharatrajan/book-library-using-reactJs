Moraco"],"publisher":"Apress","publishedDate":"2012-10-10","description":"The advent of iOS 5 and the newest Xcode has unveiled an innovative, design-centric set of tools called Storyboarding, for you to more easily conceptualize and design your app from top to bottom. A time saver for sure, but it's new! Dr. Rory Lewis, Yulia McCarthy and Stephen Moraco — a best selling Apress author, a former Apple iOS engineering group intern and a successful app developer — have teamed up to bring you this book, Beginning iOS Storyboarding. The three authors have found a beautiful way to lead the beginner into Storyboarding and at the same time show old school coders of Objective-C the new and exquisite methodology of this incredible tool. For the beginner who has never programmed, Beginning iOS Storyboarding shows how to extract those cool and innovative app ideas you have in your head into a working app ready for sale on the iTunes store by using Apple's new technology that allows you to skip chunks of code by just dragging scenes and segues onto your Storyboard canvas. Even if you're an intermediate or pro-level Objective-C developer, you can still learn the ins and outs of Xcode's new Storyboarding feature, and find new ways of building and debugging your new Storyboarding app. Yup: This book is also for you, too. In this book, you get the following, beyond learning the fundamentals and classical elements of Storyboarding: Design and build utilities and a location based service app using Storyboarding techniques Design and build a universal app with a rich user interface and user experience (UX) Create a fun game app, and more What you’ll learn How iOS Storyboarding is like a different planet in the Xcode universe. We do this by introducing you to the standard transitions to views, passing data to the views, returning data from the views, and, lastly, showing how to navigate the critical transitions to views. How to develop a simple utility app using Storyboarding. Here we learn the foundation of many apps, which is how to place controls on the settings screen of a utility application and to return those settings to the main view of the app via the settings view delegate protocol. How to develop an app with an advanced MKMapView. Specifically, we introduce you to override the default views provided by Apple’s initial project templates. This opens the door to you being able to code specialized views such as MKMapView, and utilize iOS Location Services for building navigation-based apps. What are the cool, powerful tools that enable you to create page controller view transitions. We dig deep into the ins and outs of how to apply the UIPageControls to display views and supply traditional view notification to controlled views. How to create a very cool universal app while you learn how to develop table views, which in the iPad case, present themselves differently depending upon the device orientation using the UISplitViewController. How to build a universal app with two Storyboards (one for iPhone, one for iPad) and provide techniques and tips for developing universal apps. How to build a tabbed app that stores and manages user documents in the iCloud. How to develop a cool game app which stretches your knowledge of how segues can be used to provide much more complex navigation paths between screens and devices, as well as accessibility with Apple’s iOS Game Center. Who this book is for This book is for the beginner who has never programmed, but can use the Storyboarding tool in Xcode to get up and running fast. This book is also for experienced iOS developers who wish to learn Storyboarding to quickly cut down on their app development and debugging time.

This book will also cover many other tools that go into building a complete web application: React Router, React-Bootstrap, Redux, Babel, and webpack. Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React. The popular MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms. But it has its shortcomings such as lack of support for SEO friendly server-side rendering and being too prescriptive by being a framework. Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack. What You Will Learn Discover the details of React, the React Way, and how to get the maximum out of this library See the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node, enough to build a web app Work with other tools complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap and React Router Use the tools required to build JavaScript based SPAs Tie all the components together to build a complete web app. Who This Book Is For Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack.

When he rounded the corner he assessed the situation and shook his head. “Come on, Isabelle,” he commanded, and I stood without hesitation. “You have to admit, sir, she has your fire,” the man watching over me commented. \"Aye, too much for a girl. Let’s go,” with that he turned heel and I trailed behind him. I concentrated on the ground as he led me outside of my language tutor’s estate. His strides were long and sure and I had to skip steps to keep up with him. “Why this time?” he asked with the authority I associated with his work. “Stephan said I was just a stupid girl. When I told him to shut up he called me a bitch…” I explained under my breath. “Surely, beating him to submission proved him wrong.” Father glowered down at me from the corner of his eye. “Lord Radcliff says that’s the worst thing you can call a lady!” I retorted. “I would agree with Lord Radcliff, however my daughter is no lady.” I felt tears of anger well up in my eyes, and I hid them with the cloth. “Do you prefer Sir Garrett Rhodes’ brat?” “No!” “I’ve heard it from your instructors, Isabelle. You are ten years old now, and if a boy calls you a name you ignore him. If you so badly want to be a lady, then act like it.” My empty fingers balled into a fist, but I couldn’t hold it long- pain seared across my knuckles. My joints ached and the cuts burned. I said nothing and held back my complaints. In Father’s eyes, I should have been on the worse end of the fight. When we arrived home, my mother took one look at me and rushed me into the washroom, ordering a servant to fetch hot water. She carefully moved the hand that held the towel and looked over my black eye. “Oh sweet, haven’t you learned?” she admonished. “I couldn’t help it…Stephan called me awful names…” I touched the cloth back to my throbbing eye. “Get yourself out of those filthy clothes. I’ll be right back.” She kissed my forehead and returned to the front room. I hadn’t had the chance to undress completely before the bickering drifted through the door. “Elaine, how else am I supposed to teach her that what she’s doing is wrong?” Father bellowed. “Not by ignoring her!” “You remember the last time she boxed a peer? This is nothing compared to that!” I sighed as I slipped off my skirts. He wasn’t wrong—Lady Millie had threatened to never teach me again if I ever lay a hand on another one of her students. But Patrick had said the most vile things about my mother… “Garrett, you need to be her father, not her bailiff.” Mother said as the servant filled the tub to completion. I carefully stepped into the scalding water. Air hissed through my teeth when every open cut was exposed to the bath, and it took me longer than usual to settle myself. Mother returned just as I settled, the water sitting comfortably at my neckline. “I’m sorry, love. Let’s get you cleaned up.” Unfortunately, it wasn’t the last fight I’d find myself in.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781370126743"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1370126743"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.1.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EoRyDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EoRyDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EoRyDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=react&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EoRyDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://market.android.com/details?id=book-EoRyDQAAQBAJ","id":"EoRyDQAAQBAJ","shelf":"none"},{"title":"Act and React","subtitle":"Worship Scripts for Chapel and Sanctuary","authors":["Kevin Stone"],"publishedDate":"1998-11-01","description":"Kevin Stone, educator, churchman, and freelance dramatist, presents this collection of worship scripts for chapel and sanctuary designed to transmit biblical truth in ways that attract attention.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0834198592"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780834198593"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":96,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Drama"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pk_fZmoa1soC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pk_fZmoa1soC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pk_fZmoa1soC&q=react&dq=react&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pk_fZmoa1soC&dq=react&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Act_and_React.html?hl=&id=Pk_fZmoa1soC","id":"Pk_fZmoa1soC","shelf":"none"}]}
